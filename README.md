Switch between completely isolated OpenCode environments with one command.<br>
Different MCPs, agents, models, plugins, and `AGENTS.md` files. No manual config surgery.

## Quick Start

```sh
# migrate your current OpenCode config once
❯ opm init
✓ Initialized opm
  Created default profile at ~/.config/opm/profiles/default/

# create a second environment for a different context
❯ opm create work
✓ Created profile work
  ~/.config/opm/profiles/work/

# switch instantly
❯ opm use work
✓ default → work
  ~/.config/opencode → profiles/work

❯ opm list
○ default
● work
```

Each profile is a full OpenCode config directory. Switching changes what `~/.config/opencode` points to, so OpenCode keeps using the same path it already knows.

This is the exact flow a short terminal demo will show once the README gets a recorded walkthrough.

## The Problem

### Config files shouldn't slow you down.

You use OpenCode for work with strict MCPs and a locked model, for personal projects with different tools and a relaxed `AGENTS.md`, and for experimenting with new tooling you don't want near a working setup. Every context switch means editing files by hand — tedious, error-prone, and one bad paste away from breaking something.

opm treats each context as a first-class **profile**: a full, isolated `~/.config/opencode/` directory. Switching is a single symlink swap.

<br>

**Completely isolated** — Each profile has its own MCPs, agents, models, plugins, and `AGENTS.md`. Nothing bleeds between contexts.

**Atomic switching** — The symlink swap is atomic. There is no window where `~/.config/opencode` is absent or in a bad state. Reload OpenCode after switching to pick up the new profile.

**Your workflow, completely unchanged** — opm works transparently beneath OpenCode. Your active profile lives at `~/.config/opencode` — the same path OpenCode has always used. Edit configs, install MCPs, add agents — everything works exactly as it always has. Any tool that writes to `~/.config/opencode` is writing directly into your active profile. No special paths, no wrapper commands.

**Safe to experiment** — Clone a working profile, break things freely. Your production config is never touched. Switch back to restore it.

## Commands

### The complete surface area.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `opm init [--as <name>]` | Migrate your existing config into opm management. Non-destructive. The initial profile is named `default` unless overridden with `--as`. |
| `opm create <name>` | Create a new empty profile. Use `--from` to clone an existing profile as the starting point. |
| `opm use <name>` | Switch the active profile via atomic symlink swap. Reload OpenCode to pick up the new profile. |
| `opm list [-l]` | List all profiles. Active marked `●`. Dangling marked `✗` and shown as missing. Pass `-l` to include paths. |
| `opm show` | Print the name of the currently active profile. |
| `opm copy <src> <dst>` | Clone a profile to a new name. |
| `opm rename <old> <new>` | Rename a profile. Updates the symlink atomically if active. |
| `opm remove <name...>` | Remove one or more profiles. Refuses the active profile without `--force`. |
| `opm path <name>` | Print the absolute path to a profile directory. Useful for scripting. |
| `opm inspect <name>` | Show profile details and directory contents. |
| `opm doctor` | Run installation health checks. Exits with code 1 on failure. |
| `opm reset` | Remove opm management and restore `~/.config/opencode` as a plain directory. |

**Shell completion** — profile names are tab-completed for `use`, `copy`, `rename`, `remove`, `path`, and `inspect`:

```sh
opm completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/opm   # bash
opm completion zsh  > "${fpath[1]}/_opm"           # zsh
opm completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/opm.fish  # fish
```

## How it works

`opm init` moves your existing `~/.config/opencode/` into a named profile directory — `default` by default, or a name of your choosing with `--as` — and replaces it with a symlink. From that point on, `opm use <name>` atomically repoints the symlink to a different profile:

```
~/.config/opencode  →  ~/.config/opm/profiles/work/
```

Everything OpenCode reads and writes goes to the active profile transparently.

```
~/.config/opm/
├── current                  # active profile name (plain text)
└── profiles/
    ├── default/             # full OpenCode config directories
    ├── work/
    └── personal/
```
